# Cat-and-Dog-Classifer
## Project Idea:
Create a cat and dog image classifier using Machine Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to distinguish between images of cats and dogs with high accuracy.
## Application:
This project can be used in pet identification apps, automated tagging systems for photo organization, and animal shelter databases to streamline the categorization and management of pet images.
